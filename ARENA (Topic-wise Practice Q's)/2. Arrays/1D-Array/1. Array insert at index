Array insert at index

Problem Statement
Insertion is a basic but frequently used operation. Arrays in most languages cannot be dynamically shrinked 
or expanded. Here, we will work with such arrays and try to insert an element at some index.

You are given an array arr. The size of the array is given by sizeOfArray. You need to insert an element at 
given index and print the modified array.
Input
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input.
The first line contains size of the array denoted by sizeOfArray, element to be inserted and index.
The third line contains sizeOfArray-1 elements separated by spaces.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= sizeOfArray <= 10^4
0 <= element, arr(i) <= 10^6
0 <= index <= sizeOfArray-1
Output
For each testcase, in a new line, print the modified array.
Example
Input:
2
6 90 5
1 2 3 4 5
6 90 2
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
1 2 3 4 5 90
1 2 90 3 4 5

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 90 in inserted at index 5(0-based indexing). 
            After inserting, array elements are like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90.
Testcase 2: 90 in inserted at index 2(0-based indexing). 
            After inserting, array elements are like 1, 2, 90, 3, 4, 5.

    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = in.nextInt();

        {
            int length = in.nextInt();
            int element = in.nextInt();
            int index = in.nextInt();
            int arr[] = new int[length];
            for(int k = 0; k < length; k++)
            {
                if(k == index)
                    arr[k] = element;
                else   
                    arr[k] = in.nextInt();   
            }
            for(int j = 0; j < length; j++)
                System.out.print(arr[j]+" ");
            System.out.println();
        }
         
    }
}
